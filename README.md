timmer_banner.html

The code pushed focuses on creating the timmer banner for the homepage focusign on the mobile view. The timer placed is a plcaeholder for when backend programming begins.
Additionally the CSS file focuses on using variables so that when the admin portion is implemented fonts can easily be applied.

The image banner is still not where I want it to be. However, I missed that was a part of my Jira task and will be fixing it in the next sprint.
